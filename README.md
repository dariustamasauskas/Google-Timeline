## Project on Google Timeline data

The project aim is to parse JSON data generated by Google Timeline, save the parsed data and analyze it.
The data is extracted from Google account and contains the records from the period of **2014 05 - 2019 01**.

The timeline_data.csv file was created, containing the following data fields:
- counter
- timestampMs
- latitudeE7
- longitudeE7
- accuracy
