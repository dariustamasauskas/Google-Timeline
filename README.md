## Project on Google Timeline data

The project's aim is to parse JSON data, generated by Google Timeline, save the parsed data and analyze it.
The data is extracted from my Google account and contains the records from the period of **2014 05 - 2019 10**.

Data was manually extracted from personal Google account as .json file, then zipped and put on data/raw/ folder.
The parsing code was written to grab data from this folder, parse necessary fields and write them to .csv file.

The timeline_data.csv file was created on data/parsed/ folder, containing the following data fields:
- counter
- timestampMs
- latitudeE7
- longitudeE7
- accuracy
