## Project on Google Timeline data

The project's aim is to parse JSON data, generated by Google Timeline, save the parsed data and analyze visited countries.

Google Timeline data was extracted from my personal Google account and contains the records from the period of **2014 03 - 2019 10**. The data was manually extracted as .json file, then zipped and put on data/raw/ folder.

The parsing code was written to grab data from this folder, parse necessary fields and write them to .csv file. The timeline_data.csv file was created on data/parsed/ folder, containing the following data fields:
- id
- timestampMs
- latitudeE7
- longitudeE7
- accuracy

Parse data was loaded into Jupyter notebook, cleaned up and grouped by date calculating the coordinates for each day. By using geopy, country information was extracted by providing the coordinates. Finally the analysis was done to understand visited countries during the whole period. The analysis could be found in the following file:
- analysis.ipynb
